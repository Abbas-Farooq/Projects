# C# Command-Line Calculator
This is a simple, yet powerful, command-line calculator built in C#. It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to continuously run in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations without needing to restart the program. It will keep running until explicitly told to stop by the user.

## Features:

### Basic Arithmetic Operations:
The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You simply enter two numbers and choose the operation.

### Unlimited Calculations:
Thereâ€™s no limit to how many calculations the program can perform. After each calculation, the user is prompted to either enter another calculation or stop the program.

### Endless Loop:
The calculator runs in an infinite loop, which means it will keep prompting the user for input until they choose to exit. This makes it ideal for quick and repeated calculations without restarting the program.

### Error Handling:
Basic error handling is included to handle invalid inputs, like non-numeric values or division by zero, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### User-friendly Interface:
The program uses a simple text-based interface, where the user is prompted to input numbers and select an operation. After each calculation, the result is displayed before prompting for the next calculation or allowing the user to stop.

### How it works:

The program starts by prompting the user to input the first number.
The user is then asked to choose an arithmetic operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
The second number is input, and the result of the operation is displayed.
After each calculation, the user can choose to continue with another calculation or type "exit" to stop the program.
