# Rock Paper Scissors In C#

This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game created in C# where the user competes against a computer. Initially, 
I struggled with some coding challenges that caused me to abandon the project for a while. However, after completing two other programming projects and gaining more experience, 
I regained the confidence to tackle the issue. Through a process of trial and error, I was able to debug and fix the error, successfully finishing the game.

The game allows users to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one of the three options as well. 
The program compares the choices to determine the winner based on traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The final result is displayed to the player, with an option to play again.

This project was a great learning experience, teaching me not only about handling game logic but also about overcoming obstacles and persistence in programming. 
The initial frustration turned into a sense of achievement as I was able to fix the problem and complete the game successfully.
