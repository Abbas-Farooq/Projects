# Tic Tac Toe - 2 Player

This Tic Tac Toe game is a 2-player,
turn-based game I built using C# as part of a personal project. 
It took me a few hours to create, with a number of challenges along the way. 
As this was my first time using a new level of C# programming, I encountered several complications, 
including managing user input, updating the game board, and ensuring that the game logic worked smoothly.

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking spaces with either an 'X' or 'O'. 
The goal is to get three of the same symbol in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The program includes basic features such as input validation to prevent players from marking an already occupied space, 
checking for a win or a draw, and alternating turns between the two players.

I had to figure out how to properly handle event-driven programming, 
especially the logic for switching turns and updating the game state dynamically. Additionally, working with arrays and loops to manage the grid was a significant learning experience. There were moments when things didn’t work as expected, and debugging took some time, but in the end, the game came together and I’m proud of the outcome.

Overall, this project served as an excellent introduction to some of the more complex concepts in C# and game development, a
nd I look forward to improving and expanding on it in the future with the intent of making the computer able to play against.
