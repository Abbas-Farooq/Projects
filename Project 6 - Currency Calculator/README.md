# Currency Converter Application
This is a simple console-based Currency Converter program written in C#. It allows users to convert amounts between five different currencies: US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), and Indian Rupee (INR).

## The program works as follows:

The user selects the source currency (the currency to convert from).
The user enters the amount to convert.
The user selects the target currency (the currency to convert to).

The program then calculates and displays the converted amount based on predefined exchange rates.
The exchange rates used are hardcoded into the program for simplicity. In a real-world application, these rates could be fetched from an online API to ensure they are always up-to-date.

## Features:
Easy-to-use text-based interface.
Supports conversion between five major currencies.
Converts currency by first calculating the equivalent amount in US Dollars (USD), then converting that amount into the target currency.
