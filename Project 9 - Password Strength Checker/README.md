# Password Strength Checker
The Password Strength Checker is a simple console application that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords. 
It checks whether a password meets essential security requirements and then provides feedback on how to make the password stronger.

## How It Works:
Password Evaluation: The program checks the password based on four basic criteria:

Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
Lowercase Letters: The password should include at least one lowercase letter.
Uppercase Letters: The password must have at least one uppercase letter.
Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (like !, @, #, etc.).
Password Strength Classification: Based on these checks, the password is classified as:

Strong: If the password meets all the above conditions.
Medium: If itâ€™s missing one requirement (like a special character).
Weak: If it fails to meet several key criteria, like missing both uppercase and lowercase letters, or numbers.
User Feedback: After checking the password, the program gives the user a message indicating the strength of their password, and if needed, suggests improvements.

## Key Features:

Easy-to-Use: Simply enter your password, and the program will analyze it in seconds.
Security Recommendations: The program suggests how to improve a password if it doesn't meet the strength requirements.
Simple and Fast: It uses basic string checks to validate the password, making it efficient and quick.
Example of How It Works:
User Input: MyP@ssw0rd123
Result: "Strong" (meets all the requirements).
User Input: password123
Result: "Medium" (needs at least one special character).
User Input: pass
Result: "Weak" (too short, missing uppercase, digits, and special characters).

### Why This is Useful:
This project helps users understand the importance of creating secure passwords that are harder for hackers to guess. It also teaches essential programming skills like handling strings, 
using conditionals, and giving users helpful feedback.
